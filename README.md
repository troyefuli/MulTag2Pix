# MulTag2Pix:Multi-character Line Art Colorization with Style Transfer using Text Tags
[Abstract]  Line art illustrations often depict multiple characters, yet existing automatic colorization approaches typically focus on single-character line art, leaving a gap in research for multi-character line art colorization. Moreover, automatic colorization methods without user guidance often fail to meet users' personalized needs. To address these issues, we propose MulTag2Pix, a multi-character line art colorization network based on color text tags, which caters to personalized and interactive colorization demands. In colorization tasks, uncertainty or impreciseness of users' coloring demands often results in incongruous color matching. To solve this problem, we innovatively integrate style transfer into our method in order to ensure overall consistency and naturalness in the style. Additionally, the color bleeding and color error issues severely affect the quality of colorization. To address this, we generate skeleton maps as supplementary inputs for the colorization stage, providing more accurate character structure and region segmentation information, which avoid inconsistent colors within a given semantic region. We evaluate our network on a large-scale illustration dataset. Experimental results show that our network achieves high-quality personalized colorization of line art across multiple characters. Furthermore, our network also outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates the superior colorization effect in single-character line art colorization.
